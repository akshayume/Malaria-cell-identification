ABSTRACT
Malaria poses a global health problem every day, as it affects millions of lives all over the world. Traditional diagnoses are time-consuming and prone to error. Thus, automated identification and classification of malaria type and stage of advancement can offer patients with a faster and more accurate diagnosis. Our application is able to classify between malaria and non-malaria infected cell. The model is trained using a resnet50 model which uses keras. It has achieved 94% validation accuracy. At the end an application using streamlit to classify a given image is deployed.
